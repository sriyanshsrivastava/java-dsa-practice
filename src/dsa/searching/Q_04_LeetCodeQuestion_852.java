    Peak index in a Mountain Array.

    let's call an array arr a mountain if the following properties hold.
    -- array.length>=3
    -- there exist some i with 0 < i < arr.length -1 such that:
        * arr[0]< arr[1]< arr[2]<....arr[i-1]< arr[i]
        * arr[i]> arr[i+1]> arr[2]>.... >arr[arr.length - 1]

    given an integer array arr that is guaranteed to be a mountain, return any i
    such that arr[0]<arr[1]<......arr[i-1]<arr[i]>arr[i+1]>.....>arr[arr.length-1]

    Example:
           Input: arr = [0,1,0]
           output: 1
